You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 1. Failure to do so will result in deduction of points.

I completed all parts of the assignment and they are all functioning and outputting correctly.

Segmentation bugs because not overloading operators correctly and not handling the dynamically allocated memory. 

./test_chain < test_input_file should be the correct command to run after you compile the cpp file;

input file is test_input_file;

The object of this assignment was to make sure you are able to handle your own data type called a Chain where the user inputs a line containing the size of the items in the chain and the items itself and outputting and holding those items in the chain which can be accessed using concatenation and outputting position in the chain of the items.
